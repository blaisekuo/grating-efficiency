My background? I'm basically a Hawaiian Pizza.

You know about the Hawaiian Pizza right? It's an Italian dish, invented by a Greek in Canada, named after an American state and happens to be most popular in Australia.

In the end, enjoy it for what it is, or loathe it for it's assault on sensibilities. I guess if there is a goal, maybe I want to be less polarizing than the Hawaiian Pizza.
